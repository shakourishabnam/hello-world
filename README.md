# hello-world
I'm an IT student at TAFE,Sydney branch. After mastering in Literature few years ago, I wanted to learn about a new field which is quite different from literature. Currently I am learning about different subjects. PHP is one of the scripting languages that I am  learning this term. Emerging Technologies, Project Management and Data Base are other subjects I've got to learn about.
